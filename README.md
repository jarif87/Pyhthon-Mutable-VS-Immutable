# Pyhthon-Mutable-VS-Immutable

# Python data types are categorized into two as follows:

- Mutable Data Types: Data types in python where the value assigned to a variable can be changed. Some mutable data types in Python include set, list, user-defined classes and dictionary.
- Immutable Data Types: Data types in python where the value assigned to a variable cannot be changed. Some immutable data types in Python are int, decimal, float, tuple, bool, range and string.

| Mutable  | Immutable |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| The objects can be modified after the creation as well. | Objects can not be modified after the creation of the objects. |
| Classes that are mutable are not considered final. | Classes that are immutable are considered final  |
|Thread unsafe.|Thread-safe.|
|Classes are not made final for the mutable objects.|Classes are made final for the immutable objects |
|Example: Lists, Dicts, Sets, User-Defined Classes, Dictionaries, etc.| Example: int, float, bool, string, Unicode, tuple, Numbers, etc.  |
